need a way to have a better way of dynamic inputs 

list of previous moves (previous moves for other snakes?)
vision - instead of checking adjacent squares, broaden vision until wall/other snake/my snake
    distance to myself (-1 if not found?) 
    distance to apple 
    distance to wall  
length
distance to tail? 
moves to get apple? 
direction? 
snake head 


not sure how to go about having multiple snakes in game 
distance to wall and other snakes be considered the same ? 
    probably not 


"health" max moves to get apple 
    7x7 seems to start at 100 and go down by 1 for each move 

15% chance another apple spawns

mvp - singleplayer
7x7 
vision and previous moves 

snake is free to move in any direction at the start of the round 
snake starts in random position each time
snake length starts at 1, then automatically goes to 3
    if we eat an apple before we reach 3, we just keep adding more to the snake every move
looks like there is always 2 apple at spawn 
there is 15% chance to spawn another apple every move
on the 4th move, we can check whether or not we run into ourselves
    this is because the snake starts with length 3 and has the same coordinates 
believe we can just use the direction to get the action since they are related 
    return the direction in `info` dictionary and disregard the action var

interesting idea :
have inputs for the whole board on apples 
same could be said for snake body


DUELS 

* snake that is larger will eat the other snake 
    * snake can come from any direction
    * same length, both die 
* if snake runs into another snake it dies, no matter the length
* snakes start in random location
