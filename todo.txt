need a way to have a better way of dynamic inputs 

list of previous moves (previous moves for other snakes?)
vision - instead of checking adjacent squares, broaden vision until wall/other snake/my snake
    distance to myself (-1 if not found?) 
    distance to apple 
    distance to wall  
length
distance to tail? 
moves to get apple? 
direction? 
snake head 


not sure how to go about having multiple snakes in game 
distance to wall and other snakes be considered the same ? 
    probably not 


"health" max moves to get apple 
    7x7 seems to start at 100 and go down by 1 for each move 

15% chance another apple spawns

mvp - singleplayer
7x7 
vision and previous moves 

snake is free to move in any direction at the start of the round 
snake starts in random position each time
snake length starts at 1, then automatically goes to 3
    if we eat an apple before we reach 3, we just keep adding more to the snake every move
looks like there is always 2 apple at spawn 
there is 15% chance to spawn another apple every move
on the 4th move, we can check whether or not we run into ourselves
    this is because the snake starts with length 3 and has the same coordinates 
believe we can just use the direction to get the action since they are related 
    return the direction in `info` dictionary and disregard the action var

interesting idea :
have inputs for the whole board on apples 
same could be said for snake body


DUELS 

* snake that is larger will eat the other snake 
    * snake can come from any direction
    * same length, both die 
* if snake runs into another snake it dies, no matter the length
* snakes start in random location


First things to get working :
* making snake multiplayer 
    * 2d list for snakes or dict ?
    * [ [ [1,2], [1,3] ], [ [2,3], [4,5] ] ]
* testing out between random actions for now and human input / or both human input  
* make steps take list of actions
* make AI envs
* snake player file with direction and snake position
* normalizing observation 

maybe steps should be sequential meaning 
move all snakes at once and check whether they eat apple / collide with wall / max moves 
check whether they collide with others snakes 

so combinging movign snake and eating apple / collisiosn with wall etc 

environment will have to determine reward due to whether or not we won the game 
pass through whether we ate an apple and then determine 

 I think we should pass reward and then if we calculate that we won we can cahnge the reward 
 will also have to caluclate if we run into anotehr snakes and change reward 

seems like for every observation, we see the other observations of all the other snakes (really big list)


* do snake render
    * light shade for head
    * middle shade for body 
    * dark shade for tail
    * presets (up to 8)

* check health of snake

* test :(

# update how big observation is 
# check action space 
* update reset state 


* script for colors 
* check obs 

* WERID BEHAVEIOR 
if a snake dies and another snake runs into the one thats dead, does he also die ?? ? rn, no


* FPS issues
        * just a problem with running 1 
    * check previous snake in single env 
    * figure out dummyvecenv??

* normalize inputs 
    * sight obs range [-1, 1]
    * rest should be [0, 1]
    * have to calcluate like values, can't group everything up 
        * create multiple fucntions for each type 

* render screen
    *lenght of each snake 
    * who wins at end 


# check start spawning of each snake (is there a certain distance they must be apart? )
# reward for eating another snake should be higher 
# implement reward for less moves ?? 


# intitiate to zero for prev action 
# look into difference betwen negative nad postiive values for obs 
# redo rewards for better sum zero 

# clip values between 0 and 1 
look at obs 
# add how many moves each snake has to render screen
